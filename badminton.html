            I've been playing badminton since I was a kid, usually
            with friends in the neighborhood or at the park. It's always been 
            enjoyable for me, trying to control the shuttlecock with my racket. 
            But don't get the wrong idea—I'm no pro. I didn't even make it into 
            the Badminton NSO. 
        <br><br>
            Still, every weekend, rain or shine, you'll probably catch me at the 
            Gymkhana, bouncing on my toes, eyes darting like a bouncing ball,
            just itching for my chance to swat at that shuttlecock and show off my 
            "world-famous" badminton skills—or lack thereof!
