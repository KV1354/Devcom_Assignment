    <p id="content">I started coding in 11th grade when I learned Python. Since then, 
        I've enjoyed making things with code and seeing them work how I want. I've 
        learned Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Admittedly, the latter three 
        are still areas where I'm refining my skills. But who knows what's kept in 
        the future. </p>
